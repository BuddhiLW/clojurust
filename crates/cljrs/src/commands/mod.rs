//! Internal command implementations for the `cljrs` binary.
//!
//! Each module owns one top-level subcommand: its clap arguments, its
//! `run` entry point, and any helpers that exist only to serve it.
//! [`crate::cli`] wires the argument types into the top-level `Commands` enum
//! and dispatches to the `run` functions; anything two subcommands share lives
//! in [`crate::session`] or [`crate::native`] instead.
