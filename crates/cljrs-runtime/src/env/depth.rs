//! Call-depth cap for [`ExecutionMode::NoGcTransaction`].
//!
//! Every interpreted application consumes real Rust stack, so a hostile or
//! merely runaway transaction could overflow the host thread's stack and abort
//! the process.  A runtime built in [`ExecutionMode::NoGcTransaction`] routes
//! its calls through [`call_cljrs_fn`], which refuses to nest deeper than the
//! limit installed by [`DepthGuard`].
//!
//! This used to be a `call_cljrs_fn` function pointer that `cljrs-tx` stored in
//! `GlobalEnv`.  It is the one call-path override that had a reason to exist,
//! so it survives the removal of the seam — as an execution mode owned by the
//! runtime rather than as an arbitrary hook.
//!
