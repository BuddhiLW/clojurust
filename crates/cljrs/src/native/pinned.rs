//! Native packages: build a dependency's Rust crate as a cdylib and load it
//! (`:rust/load :dylib` in `cljrs.edn`).
//!
//! Two dependency forms reach this module, and they differ only in where the
//! crate's source comes from:
//!
//! - `:git/url` + `:git/sha` — an immutable commit. Serves both `require` and
//!   versioned (`mylib/f@<sha>`) resolution; its artifact is cached forever.
//! - `:local/root` — a working tree, built as it currently stands. Serves
//!   `require` only (there is no commit to resolve `@<sha>` against), and is
//!   versioned by a digest of the tree, so an edit is a different build.
//!
//! By default, a pinned symbol (`mylib/f@<sha>`) that resolves to a native
//! (Rust-backed) function falls back to the **current binary's**
//! implementation, with provenance verification (see
//! `cljrs_runtime::env::versioned`).  This module provides the opt-in
//! alternative: true out-of-binary native code.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. `install(globals)` registers the loader hooks on the environment.  The
//!    versioned resolver calls one whenever a pinned lookup is about to fall
//!    back to a native function; `require` calls the other for a namespace no
//!    source path provides.
//! 2. The hook checks `cljrs.edn` for a dep covering the namespace with
//!    `:rust/load :dylib` and a `:rust/init` function.
//! 3. The dep's source is materialized — fetched and checked out at the
//!    pinned commit (`cljrs_project::vcs`), or taken as-is from
//!    `:local/root` — and wrapped in a generated cdylib crate that pins the
//!    exact same `cljrs-interop` as the host.
//! 4. `cargo build` in the host's profile (cached per `(crate, source, rustc,
//!    cljrs version)`), then `dlopen`.
//! 5. **ABI handshake**: the wrapper exports `cljrs_dylib_abi()` returning
//!    a fingerprint string (cljrs version + `rustc -V`, baked at the
//!    wrapper's build time).  The host refuses to proceed unless it equals
//!    the host's own fingerprint exactly.
//! 6. The wrapper's `cljrs_dylib_init(*mut Registry)` registers the
//!    package's exports through a [`Registry::versioned`] view, so the
//!    pinned implementations land in the immutable `"<ns>@<commit>"`
//!    namespace and never collide with the live ones.
//!
//! ## Safety model (experimental)
//!
//! `cljrs_dylib_init` crosses the boundary with a Rust-ABI `&mut Registry`.
//! This is sound *only* because the handshake guarantees both sides were
//! compiled by the identical compiler against the identical `cljrs-interop`
//! version.  Feature-flag skew between host and wrapper builds is not
//! detected; the whole mechanism is opt-in and documented as experimental.
//! A full C-ABI vtable is the safer long-term design and is deliberately
//! deferred.

// EvalError is large by design across the workspace (same allow as cljrs-runtime).
