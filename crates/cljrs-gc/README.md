# cljrs-gc

Non-moving, stop-the-world mark-and-sweep garbage collector for clojurust;
or, with the `no-gc` Cargo feature, a region-based allocator with no GC pauses.

On `wasm32` targets the `system-memory` crate is excluded (it brings in `errno`,
which does not build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`).  The process governor's
default hard limit is a fixed **256 MiB** instead of a fraction of system RAM.

**Phase:** 8.1 (GcVisitor + Trace infrastructure) + 8.2 (GcBox/GcHeap
raw-pointer implementation) — implemented.  `no-gc` mode (Phases 1–8 of
`docs/archive/no-gc-plan.md`) — implemented.  B3 (`StaticGcPtr`, `static_alloc`) —
implemented.  Process memory governor
(`docs/managed-memory-governor-plan.md`) — Phases 0–2 (observe-only
accounting with chunked allocation credit) implemented.

---

## Purpose

Manages all Clojure runtime values.  `GcPtr<T>` is a raw pointer into either
the GC heap or a bump-allocated region; `clone` is O(1); `drop` is a no-op.

**Default build (GC mode):** memory is freed only during `GcHeap::collect`.

**Region provenance tagging (GC mode):** region-allocated `GcPtr`s carry a
low-bit tag (`REGION_PTR_TAG`; `GcBox<T>` is ≥8-aligned so bit 0 is free).
`MarkVisitor::visit` checks the tag *without dereferencing* and **skips**
region objects — a region whose scope has ended leaves dangling pointers whose
headers are freed/reused memory, so tracing them would follow a garbage
`trace_fn`.  Because the mark phase no longer traces *into* region objects,
`GcHeap::collect` instead treats every live region on the thread's region
stack as a root (`region::trace_active_regions`), so heap objects reachable
only through a live region are still kept alive.  `GcPtr::raw()` masks the tag
on every dereference; `GcPtr::is_region_alloc()` exposes it.

**`no-gc` build:** every function call and every `loop` iteration pushes a
scratch `Region`; intermediates are freed when the scope exits.  Return values
and `recur` arguments are evaluated in the caller's context (the
"return-expression-in-caller" mechanism).  Static-sink expressions (`def`,
`defn`, `defmacro`, `atom`, `agent`, `volatile!`, `reset!`, `vreset!`,
`swap!`, `vswap!`, `alter-var-root`, `intern`) go to the global `StaticArena`
and live for the program lifetime.
No `GcHeap`, no stop-the-world pauses, no `Trace` overhead at runtime.

An isolated invocation can instead install `alloc_ctx::InvocationGuard`. In
that profile every allocation uses one bounded region; nested `ScratchGuard`
and `StaticCtxGuard` values become no-ops, so arbitrary internal graphs share
the invocation lifetime and are reclaimed together at the boundary.

**Phase 7 (debug provenance):** in `debug_assertions` builds with `no-gc`,
`StaticArena` tracks chunk ranges and exposes `is_static_addr(usize) -> bool`.
`GcPtr::is_static_alloc()` uses this to check pointer provenance at O(chunks)
cost.  `Atom::reset`, `Var::bind`, and `Volatile::reset` use `debug_assert!`
to catch region-local values being stored in program-lifetime containers.

## Public API

### `GcVisitor`

```rust
pub trait GcVisitor {
    fn visit<T: Trace + 'static>(&mut self, ptr: &GcPtr<T>);
}
```

Implemented by [`MarkVisitor`].  Call `visitor.visit(ptr)` inside
`Trace::trace` for every `GcPtr` field.

### `Trace`

```rust
pub trait Trace: Send + Sync {
    fn trace(&self, visitor: &mut MarkVisitor);

    // Default impl returns 0; override for types with significant inline-owned heap.
    fn gc_size_extra(&self) -> usize { 0 }
}
```

Implemented by every type stored behind a `GcPtr`.  Must call
`visitor.visit(ptr)` for every `GcPtr` reachable from `self` (directly or
through `Arc`/`Mutex`/etc.).

`gc_size_extra` returns heap bytes owned by the value that are NOT counted by
`size_of::<GcBox<T>>()` — Vec buffers, String capacity, Form AST trees stored
inline.  The GC adds this to the tracked `memory_in_use` so collection fires at
the right threshold.  Do NOT cross `GcPtr` boundaries — pointed-to boxes are
counted separately when allocated.

Built-in leaf impls: `String` (overrides `gc_size_extra` to return `capacity()`),
`i64`, `f64`, `bool`, `num_bigint::BigInt`, `bigdecimal::BigDecimal`,
`num_rational::Ratio<BigInt>`, and `Mutex<Vec<T>>` for the primitive array
element types (`i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64`/`f32`/`f64`/`bool`/`char`).

Compiled regular expressions are *not* here: `Trace` for them lives on
`cljrs-value`'s `Pattern` wrapper, so `cljrs-gc` does not depend on a regex
engine.

### `GcPtr<T: Trace + 'static>`

```rust
pub struct GcPtr<T: Trace + 'static>(NonNull<GcBox<T>>);

impl<T: Trace + 'static> GcPtr<T> {
    pub fn new(value: T) -> Self        // allocates on HEAP (or ctx in no-gc)
    pub fn get(&self) -> &T             // borrow; invalid after collect frees it
    pub fn ptr_eq(a: &Self, b: &Self) -> bool

    // GC mode only:
    pub fn is_region_alloc(&self) -> bool  // true if bump-allocated in a Region

    // no-gc + debug_assertions only:
    pub fn is_static_alloc(&self) -> bool  // true if allocated in StaticArena
}
impl<T: Trace + 'static> Clone for GcPtr<T> { /* O(1) raw-pointer copy */ }
impl<T: Trace + 'static> Drop  for GcPtr<T> { /* no-op */ }
```

### `StaticGcPtr<T: 'static>` (always available — Phase B3)

Program-lifetime pointer safe to share across isolate threads.  Backed by the
global `StaticArena` (in `no-gc` builds) or `Box::leak` (in GC builds).
Unlike `GcPtr`, it wraps `*const T` directly (no `GcBox` header) and is
`Send + Sync`.

```rust
pub struct StaticGcPtr<T: 'static>(NonNull<T>);

impl<T: 'static> StaticGcPtr<T> {
    pub fn get(&self) -> &T
    pub fn ptr_eq(a: &Self, b: &Self) -> bool
}
impl<T: 'static> Clone for StaticGcPtr<T> { /* O(1) NonNull copy */ }

/// Allocate `value` as program-lifetime memory.
/// no-gc: StaticArena bump-alloc; GC: Box::leak.
pub fn static_alloc<T: 'static>(value: T) -> StaticGcPtr<T>;
```

### Free functions

```rust
// always:
pub fn static_alloc<T: 'static>(value: T) -> StaticGcPtr<T>;

// no-gc only:
pub fn static_arena() -> &'static StaticArena;

// no-gc + debug_assertions only:
pub fn is_static_addr(addr: usize) -> bool;  // checks the StaticArena chunk registry
```

### `GcHeap`

```rust
pub struct GcHeap { /* Mutex<GcHeapInner> */ }

impl GcHeap {
    pub const fn new() -> Self
    pub fn alloc<T: Trace + 'static>(&self, value: T) -> GcPtr<T>
    pub fn collect<F: FnOnce(&mut MarkVisitor)>(&self, trace_roots: F)
    pub fn count(&self) -> usize
    pub fn total_allocated(&self) -> usize
    pub fn total_freed(&self) -> usize
}
```

`collect` is stop-the-world: must only be called when no other thread is
creating or dereferencing `GcPtr` values.

### `MarkVisitor`

```rust
pub struct MarkVisitor { /* grey stack */ }
impl GcVisitor for MarkVisitor { … }
```

Uses a grey stack (avoids recursion stack overflow) and handles cycles via
already-marked check.

### `HeapProxy` and `HEAP`

```rust
pub struct HeapProxy;   // zero-sized; all state in ISOLATE_HEAP thread-local

impl HeapProxy {
    pub fn alloc<T: Trace + 'static>(&self, value: T) -> GcPtr<T>
    pub fn set_config(&self, config: Arc<GcConfig>)
    pub fn set_config_from_env(&self)   // clears the fixed trigger; reads no env vars
    pub fn register_root_tracer(&self, tracer: impl Fn(&mut MarkVisitor) + 'static)
    pub fn trace_registered_roots(&self, visitor: &mut MarkVisitor)
    pub fn memory_in_use(&self) -> usize
    pub fn count(&self) -> usize
    pub fn total_allocated(&self) -> usize
    pub fn total_freed(&self) -> usize
    pub fn collect<F: FnOnce(&mut MarkVisitor)>(&self, trace_roots: F)
    pub fn collect_auto(&self) -> bool
}

pub static HEAP: HeapProxy;
```

`HEAP` is a zero-sized proxy that dispatches every operation to the calling
thread's `ISOLATE_HEAP` thread-local `GcHeap`. Each OS thread (isolate) owns
an independent heap; GC runs fully in parallel across threads with no
cross-isolate stop-the-world coordination. All `GcPtr::new` calls allocate
into the current thread's heap via this proxy.

### `region::Region`

```rust
pub struct Region { /* chunks, bump pointer, drop registry */ }

impl Region {
    pub fn new() -> Self
    pub fn with_capacity(cap: usize) -> Self
    pub fn with_limit(limit: usize) -> Self
    pub fn alloc<T: Trace + 'static>(&mut self, value: T) -> GcPtr<T>
    pub fn reset(&mut self)
    pub fn bytes_used(&self) -> usize
    pub fn accounted_bytes(&self) -> usize
    pub fn byte_limit(&self) -> Option<usize>
    pub fn object_count(&self) -> usize
}
```

`with_limit` raises the typed `RegionLimitExceeded` panic payload when the
managed allocation budget is exhausted. It charges boxes plus
`Trace::gc_size_extra`; it is not a process-wide RSS limiter.

### `alloc_ctx::InvocationGuard` (`no-gc` only)

```rust
pub struct InvocationGuard { /* one bounded Region */ }
impl InvocationGuard {
    pub fn new(byte_limit: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn accounted_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn object_count(&self) -> usize;
}
pub fn invocation_is_active() -> bool;
```

All `GcPtr::new` calls within the guard use its single arena, including calls
made beneath evaluator scratch/static guards. Copy or serialize results before
the guard drops.

Bump allocator for short-lived objects. ~2.6x faster than `GcHeap::alloc`
(no mutex, no `Box::new`). Objects are NOT in the GC heap linked list.
Destructors run on `reset()` or `drop`.

### `region::RegionGuard`

RAII guard that pushes a `Region` onto the thread-local stack. Use with
`try_alloc_in_region()` for opportunistic region allocation.

### Region poisoning / retirement (Phase 10.5)

```rust
/// Mark every region currently active on this thread: each will be *retired*
/// (kept alive forever and traced as a GC root) instead of reset when its
/// scope closes.  No-op when no region is active.
pub fn poison_active_regions();

/// Close a region whose scope ended: pop the thread-local stack entry, then
/// reset/drop the region — or retire it if poisoned.  All owners of
/// stack-registered regions (rt_abi, the IR interpreter) close through here.
pub fn close_region(region: Box<Region>);
```

The heap-promotion fallback: when a publish barrier
(`cljrs_value::publish::publish_value`) meets a value it can neither verify
nor deep-copy while regions are open, it poisons them.  Retired regions are a
deliberate bounded leak (mirroring the JIT's pinned epochs) that can never
dangle; `GcHeap::collect` traces them as roots alongside the active stack.

### `governor` — process memory governor

Every isolate keeps its private heap; the governor owns counters, pressure
policy, and thread-safe control handles.  Each isolate allocates from local
credit that the governor grants in chunks; granted credit counts as committed.
**Observe-only:** no grant is refused; a grant that ends above the hard limit
is counted as an over-limit event.

```rust
pub enum MemoryClass { GcHeap, Region, SharedValue, MessageQueue, Static, Code, Runtime }
pub enum PressureLevel { Green, Yellow, Red }   // < soft, >= soft, > hard

pub const DEFAULT_CREDIT_CHUNK: usize;             // 64 KiB
pub const DEFAULT_RETAINED_CREDIT_CHUNKS: usize;   // 2
pub const ACCOUNTING_UNIT: usize;                  // 4 KiB; rounding for large grants
pub const MIN_COLLECTION_HEADROOM: usize;          // 4 MiB

pub struct MemoryConfig { pub soft_limit, pub hard_limit, pub critical_reserve,
                          pub credit_chunk, pub retained_credit_chunks,
                          pub queue_limit }   // bytes, except the chunk count
impl MemoryConfig {
    pub fn with_limits(soft: usize, hard: usize) -> Result<Self, MemoryConfigError>;
    pub fn from_optional_limits(soft: Option<usize>, hard: Option<usize>)
        -> Result<Self, MemoryConfigError>;
    pub fn platform_default() -> Self;

}

pub fn default_critical_reserve(hard: usize) -> usize;  // max(4 MiB, 1%), <= 256 MiB
pub fn container_memory_limit() -> Option<usize>;       // not on wasm32

pub struct ProcessMemoryGovernor { /* atomics + weak isolate registry */ }
impl ProcessMemoryGovernor {
    pub const fn new() -> Self;   // reads MemoryConfig::from_env on first use
    pub fn with_config(c: MemoryConfig) -> Result<Self, MemoryConfigError>;
    pub fn configure(&self, c: MemoryConfig) -> Result<(), MemoryConfigError>;
    pub fn config(&self) -> MemoryConfig;
    pub fn register_isolate(&'static self, name: impl Into<Arc<str>>) -> IsolateAccount;
    pub fn reserve_shared(&'static self, class: MemoryClass, bytes: usize)
        -> Result<MemoryCharge, MemoryLimitExceeded>;   // never Err while observe-only
    pub fn class_bytes(&self, class: MemoryClass) -> usize;
    pub fn committed_bytes(&self) -> usize;     // exact: used + free credit
    pub fn free_credit_bytes(&self) -> usize;   // as last published by each isolate
    pub fn min_headroom(&self) -> usize;        // max(16 chunks, MIN_COLLECTION_HEADROOM)
    pub fn pressure(&self) -> PressureLevel;
    pub fn snapshot(&self) -> MemorySnapshot;
}
pub fn governor() -> &'static ProcessMemoryGovernor;   // the process instance

pub struct IsolateAccount { /* single-threaded (!Sync) Cells */ }
// Drop: returns used bytes and free credit, unregisters.
impl IsolateAccount {
    pub fn charge(&self, bytes: usize);   // thread-local until credit runs out, then refills
    pub fn release(&self, bytes: usize);  // sweep: used bytes become free credit
    pub fn publish(&self);                // metrics poll
    pub fn poll(&self) -> bool;           // safepoint: serve a recall; collection requested?
    pub fn record_collection(&self, r: CollectionReport);   // epoch, next target, trim credit
    pub fn used_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn free_credit_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn committed_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn collection_target(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn control(&self) -> &Arc<IsolateControl>;
}
pub struct IsolateControl { /* atomics */ }
impl IsolateControl {
    pub fn id(&self) -> IsolateId;
    pub fn name(&self) -> Arc<str>;
    pub fn request_collection(&self);
    pub fn collection_requested(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn take_collection_request(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn request_recall(&self);
    pub fn recall_requested(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn used_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn free_credit_bytes(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn collection_target(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn collection_epoch(&self) -> u64;
    pub fn collection_requests(&self) -> u64;
    pub fn credit_refills(&self) -> u64;
}
pub struct CollectionReport { pub bytes_before, pub bytes_after, pub bytes_returned, pub duration }
pub struct MemoryCharge;   // RAII; Drop returns its bytes once
pub struct MemoryLimitExceeded { pub class, pub requested, pub committed, pub hard_limit }
pub struct MemorySnapshot { /* limits, pressure, committed/used/free credit and peaks,
                               per class, per isolate, transitions, requests,
                               refills, returned credit, recalls, over-limit events */ }
pub struct IsolateSnapshot { /* per-isolate counters */ }

// Calling thread:
pub fn register_current_isolate(name: &str) -> Option<Arc<IsolateControl>>;
pub fn with_current_account<R>(f: impl FnOnce(&IsolateAccount) -> R) -> Option<R>;
pub fn current_control() -> Option<Arc<IsolateControl>>;
pub fn snapshot() -> MemorySnapshot;   // flushes this thread's account first
```

`GcHeap::alloc` charges the thread's account; `GcHeap::collect` releases the
freed bytes and calls `record_collection`.  A thread that allocates without
registering is registered lazily under its thread name.

Credit: a charge subtracts from local credit.  When credit runs out, the
account asks the governor for one chunk, or for the shortfall rounded up to
`ACCOUNTING_UNIT` when it exceeds a chunk.  A refill is the only time an
isolate publishes its used bytes and checks its collection target.  After a
collection, an isolate keeps at most `retained_credit_chunks` of free credit
at `Green`, one chunk at `Yellow`, and none at `Red`; it returns the rest.
When pressure rises, the governor recalls credit from every isolate, and each
returns its excess at its next refill, collection, or safepoint poll
(`gc_requested`).

Collection targets: an isolate requests its own collection when its used
bytes pass its target.  The first target is `min_headroom()`.  After each
collection the target is the surviving bytes plus the larger of the surviving
bytes or `min_headroom()`; a zero-yield collection doubles the previous
headroom instead, up to the larger of that base or a quarter of the process
soft limit.  At `Yellow` the governor also requests collection from the
allocating isolate and from the largest heap once each has grown by
`min_headroom()` since its last collection; at `Red` it requests regardless.
Either way it requests at most once per collection epoch.  Pressure
transitions log at `info` and over-limit events at `debug` under the `memory`
tracing target.

Gaps: the isolate heap is not torn down at thread exit, so
`IsolateAccount::drop` stops counting bytes that stay allocated until process
exit; regions, shared values, queues, static data, and code are not charged;
an idle isolate that never polls is not woken by a recall, so it keeps up to
its retained chunks.

### `GcConfig`

Optional fixed per-heap collection trigger.  `GcConfig::new()` (and `Default`)
sets none, so the heap follows its dynamic collection target.
`with_soft_limit(soft)` adds a trigger at `soft` with no hard limit;
`with_hard_limit(hard)` uses 75% of `hard`.  `try_with_limits` / `validate`
reject a zero hard limit and a soft limit above the hard limit.  The hard
limit is not enforced.

### `stats::GcStats` and `GC_STATS`

```rust
pub struct GcStats { /* AtomicU64 counters */ }

impl GcStats {
    pub const fn new() -> Self
    pub fn record_gc_alloc(&self, bytes: usize)
    pub fn record_gc_allocs(&self, count: u64, bytes: u64)   // batched by isolate accounts
    pub fn record_region_alloc(&self, bytes: usize)
    pub fn record_region_poison(&self)
    pub fn record_gc_pause(&self, pause: Duration, freed_objects: u64, freed_bytes: u64)
    pub fn record_boundary_crossing(&self, bytes: u64, copy_time: Duration)
    pub fn snapshot(&self) -> GcStatsSnapshot
}

pub struct GcStatsSnapshot { /* immutable view of counters */ }
impl GcStatsSnapshot {
    pub fn total_pause(&self) -> Duration
    pub fn total_boundary_copy(&self) -> Duration
}
impl std::fmt::Display for GcStatsSnapshot { /* multi-line summary */ }

pub static GC_STATS: GcStats;

pub const CLJRS_GC_STATS_ENV: &str;       // = "CLJRS_GC_STATS"
pub fn dump_stats_from_env();
pub fn report() -> String;   // GC_STATS + governor snapshot; re-exported as stats_report
```

Process-global counters updated automatically by `GcHeap::alloc`,
`GcHeap::collect`, and `Region::alloc`.  GC heap allocations are batched in
each isolate account and flushed at every credit refill, collection, metrics
poll, and thread exit, so the allocation path does not touch these shared
atomics; a reading can lag each thread by up to one chunk of allocations.  The `cljrs --gc-stats [FILE]` CLI
flag prints a snapshot of these counters at program exit.

`record_boundary_crossing` is the **metered isolate-boundary seam** required by
`docs/isolate-boundary-plan.md`: every value deep-copied across an isolate
boundary (the Phase B2 structured-clone in `cljrs-async`'s `IsolateSender::send`)
records its estimated bytes copied and serialize time here, so a silent fan-out
copy shows up in `--gc-stats` as `Boundary crossings: N (B bytes copied)` rather
than as mystery latency.

`dump_stats_from_env()` is the AOT-binary equivalent: it reads the
`CLJRS_GC_STATS` environment variable and, if set, writes a snapshot to
stdout (when the value is empty or `"-"`) or to the named file.  AOT-compiled
programs and the AOT test harness call it once at exit.

## Design notes

- **Non-moving**: `GcPtr<T>` stores a stable `NonNull<GcBox<T>>` address.
- **Stop-the-world**: `collect` must pause all other threads that hold `GcPtr`s.
- **Intrusive linked list**: all `GcBox`es are linked via `GcBoxHeader::next`.
- **Type erasure**: `trace_fn` / `drop_fn` in the header enable type-erased
  mark and sweep without a vtable pointer per allocation.
- **Accurate allocation accounting**: `GcBoxHeader::size` stores
  `size_of::<GcBox<T>>() + value.gc_size_extra()` at allocation time.
  `memory_in_use` is incremented by this total (not a flat estimate) and
  decremented by the same value when the object is freed.  Types that own
  significant out-of-line heap (Form AST trees in `CljxFn`, String capacity)
  override `gc_size_extra` so the GC threshold fires before the process OOMs.
- **Fixed-headroom GC suppression** (explicit `GcConfig` soft limit only):
  after a zero-yield collection (nothing freed), GC is suppressed until `memory_in_use` grows by another `soft_limit/10` bytes
  (a fixed additive headroom, not a percentage of current memory).  Using a
  percentage of current memory as headroom would compound across consecutive
  zero-yield cycles (e.g. during deep recursion where all objects are live),
  causing the threshold to grow exponentially and GC to stop firing permanently
  after the computation finishes — leading to OOM on long test suites.  A fixed
  headroom gives linear growth, which stays bounded.  The old trigger —
  re-enabling on every alloc-frame drop — fired O(N-heap) sweeps on every
  eval-frame return, causing a GC storm with hundreds of useless traversals.
- **Minimal grace period** (`GC_INITIAL_LIVES = 2`): objects start at `lives = 1`.
  GC only fires at explicit `gc_safepoint()` calls, not at arbitrary Rust points.
  The single cycle of grace covers the narrow window between an alloc frame
  dropping and the next safepoint at which `VALUE_ROOTS` or the new alloc frame
  re-roots the value.  The old value of 10 kept 9× more garbage in RAM than
  necessary, worsening OOM pressure under long test suites.
- **Cycle collection**: because `GcPtr::drop` is a no-op, reference cycles do
  not prevent collection — any object unreachable from roots is freed.

## Deferred to later phases

- Incremental/concurrent collection — Phase 10+
- Write barriers for generational GC — Phase 10+
- Weak references (`WeakGcPtr<T>`) — deferred
- Safepoint integration with JIT frames — Phase 10+
- Automatic collection trigger (threshold-based) — deferred
